Analyzing drift between Context and Slack (Channel: C07FMAQ3485)...

--- Analysis Result ---
Status Change Detected: True
Risk Level: Low
Reason: Multiple screenshots and messages point to ongoing UI/UX issues (black line in bottom nav bar, new chat/home screens). The project status is currently 'Green' with 'No Blockers,' which does not accurately reflect these reported issues.
Suggested Update:
Add a section in 'Raw Notes' regarding UI/UX issues reported. Update 'Overall Health' to 'Yellow' and add 'UI/UX issues' as a potential blocker. Investigate and track resolution of reported issues.
