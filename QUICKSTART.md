# 🚀 Quick Start - The Easiest Way!

Just run this and **talk to your agent**:

```bash
cd /Users/mohitkumawat/PythonAIAgent
./start_agent.sh
```

Then say things like:
- "Check my Slack mentions in the test channel"
- "Verify my setup"
- "Check for drift"

**That's it!** No need to remember complex commands! 🎉
